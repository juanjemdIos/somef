# Supported Metadata Files

This project supports extracting metadata from specific types of files commonly used to declare authorship and contribution in open source repositories.

## Supported files of authors.

The following filenames are recognized and processed automatically:

* `AUTHORS`
* `AUTHORS.md`
* `AUTHORS.txt`

These files are expected to be located at the root of the repository. Filenames are matched case-insensitively.

## Purpose and Format

These files typically contain a list of individuals and/or organizations that have contributed to the project. While there is no universal standard for formatting, a widely referenced convention is Google's guidance:

üîó [Google Open Source: Authors Files Protocol](https://opensource.google/documentation/reference/releasing/authors/)

The content may be structured as:

* Simple plain text, with one contributor per line.
* Markdown-formatted text (`.md` files).
* Lines including contributor names, emails (e.g., `Name <email>`), and sometimes affiliations.

### Examples of Valid Entries

```text
Jane Doe <jane@example.com>
John Smith
Acme Corporation <acme@mail.com>
Google Inc.
```

### Examples of NON Valid Entries

```text
JetBrains <>
Microsoft
Fraunhofer-Gesellschaft zur F√∂rderung der angewandten Forschung
scrawl - Top contributor
Tom
```
## What Is Read vs. Discarded

When processing these files, the parser will:

**Include** lines that:

* Contain person names, optionally with emails (`Name <email>`).
* Clearly refer to organizations (e.g., "Google LLC", "OpenAI Inc.").

**Discard** lines that:

* Are headers, decorative separators, or markdown formatting (`#`, `*`, `=`, etc.).
* Contain only URLs or links.
* Are single words with no email and no organizational keyword (e.g., `JetBrains <>`).
* Are markdown or structured noise (`---`, `{}`, etc.).
* Contain more than four words and are not recognized as organizations ‚Äî to avoid capturing generic or descriptive sentences (e.g., This line not is an author).

### Special Cases

* Entries with only a first name and an email are accepted but must not assign an empty `last_name`.
* Lines starting with `-` or `*` are considered lists, but only parsed if the content matches expected author patterns.
* Blocks enclosed in `{}` are stripped before parsing.
* Any line matching known organization suffixes (`Inc.`, `LLC`, `Ltd.`, `Corporation`) is treated as an organization, even if no email is present.
* Some organization names (e.g., Open Source Initiative) may be mistakenly treated as person names if they do not contain a company designator or email. To improve detection, it is recommended to use names like Open Source Initiative Inc.
* In such cases, only the meaningful part (typically the name) is extracted before any descriptive annotations.
For example, the line:
Tom Smith (Tom) - Project leader 2010-2018
Will be interpreted as:
{
  "type": "Person",
  "name": "Tom Smith",
  "value": "Tom Smith",
  "given_name": "Tom",
  "last_name": "Smith"
}

> **Note:** The general principles behind metadata mapping in SOMEF are based on the [CodeMeta crosswalk](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/blob/master/crosswalk.csv) and the [CodeMeta JSON-LD context](https://github.com/codemeta/codemeta/blob/master/codemeta.jsonld).  
> However, each supported file type may have specific characteristics and field interpretations.

## Example: Dependency Metadata Extraction from Configuration Files

SOMEF parses configuration files like `pom.xml` to extract **structured metadata** about software dependencies and other requirements.

---

### Source File: Snippet from `Widoco/pom.xml`

Below is the XML fragment for the Maven dependency that is being parsed:

```xml
<dependencies>
  <dependency>
    <groupId>org.apache.maven</groupId>
    <artifactId>maven-model</artifactId>
    <version>3.9.0</version>
  </dependency>
  </dependencies>
```


The following Python code snippet show the logic used by the SOMEF parser to transform the XML elements to the JSON metadata structure:

```
        if project_data["dependencies"]:
            for dependency in project_data["dependencies"]:
                metadata_result.add_result(
                    constants.CAT_REQUIREMENTS, 
                    {
                        "value": f'{dependency.get("groupId", "")}.{dependency.get("artifactId", "")}'.strip("."),
                        "name": dependency.get("artifactId", ""),
                        "version": dependency.get("version", ""),
                        "type": constants.SOFTWARE_APPLICATION
                    },
                    1,
                    constants.TECHNIQUE_CODE_CONFIG_PARSER,
                    source
                )
```


After applying the mapping logic, the metadata for the dependency is stored under the requirements category (CAT_REQUIREMENTS) with the following JSON structure:

``` somef json 

    "requirements": [
        {
            "result": {
                "value": "org.apache.maven.maven-model",
                "name": "maven-model",
                "version": "3.9.0",
                "type": "Software_application"
            },
            "confidence": 1,
            "technique": "code_parser",
            "source": "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dgarijo/Widoco/master/pom.xml"
        },
```
